    <h3 class="one"> Beyond personality tests being intriguing to me because of the fact that they allow for a quantitative way to organize, sort, and understand people––which, under most other circumstances, feels like an impossible task because of each individual's complexity––they amaze me, too, because of the otherwise unseeable patterns they expose when taking a closer look at any society. </h3>
    <h3 class="two"> The Enneagram is the one assessment that has made the most sense to me thus far in my explorations of various tests. That being said, I wanted to use this project as a means to look into more data to prove that this test actually has real-world validity.</h3>
    <h3 class="three">Thus, by studying patterns of Enneagram types in marriage and compairing these results to general trends in the population, I hope to convince any viewers that this test has meaning and can be applied in the real-world.</h3>
    <h3 class="four">Thank you and happy exploring!</h3>
