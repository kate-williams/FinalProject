    The sources I have found thus far (as of 9/20/20) are:
    - http://www.9types.com/writeup/enneagram_relationships.php , which I believe to be credible because it is a first-person account of a study done. 
    - https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/ which is credible because it is the founder of the test. 
    - and then I am still looking for a third set of data which would demonstrate the distribution of the types within the world, but I do want to find a strong source for this information.
