        <h3>As demonstrated on the interactive dashboard, not only does the Enneagram allow for another means of assessing the population, but it also reveals information about marriage rates among types of people and common pairings in marriage.</h3>
     <h3>But why does this matter?</h3>
     <h3>Marriage success rates in the United States are at an all-time low. Based on the common pairings exposed in the Enneagram data, dating apps and even couples' therapists can use the information about successful pairings to work with and encourage couples in the right direction. </h3>
        <h3>While the data about married couples used did not specify that these were happy partnerships, nor how long they lasted, the exposed patterns still imply that there are pairings that lead to marriage more often than others. Given that there is somewhat limited exploration of The Ennegram in the real world, too, there is still room for data collection and experimentation within these areas.</h3>
